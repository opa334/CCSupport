# CCSupport

## Features
- Loads third party modules

- Redirects module configuration to different file (ensures nothing is broken when the tweak isn't loaded)

- Unlocks fixed modules in settings (with proper icons and names)

- Button to reset module configuration in settings

- Provides additional functionality, so that developers can specify a custom size for their modules and include a preference page.

## Compiling
- Make sure to install the [module template](https://github.com/opa334/CCSupportModuleTemplate) first to get the required ControlCenter related headers

## Localization
If you wish to help with localizing the tweak, take the english template from [here](https://github.com/opa334/CCSupport/blob/master/layout/Library/Application%20Support/CCSupport/en.lproj/Localizable.strings) and contact me somewhere with the localized file.
